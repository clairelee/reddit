          <div class="info-intro">We all love Reddit. It's a brilliant place where you socialize with people you share similar interests, or just to kill time and look through cat gifs. However, its design reminds us of the 1990s. Let's give Reddit some new, fresh coat of paint using our knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS!</div>

        <p>You are not expected to create the "functionalities" for each view: when you click on a button or a link it wouldn't do anything. You are basically only creating a mockup.</p><p>Also, you are not required to create the UI for all the features in each view; for example, you may skip the calendar view in the main page.
